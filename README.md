## About this Resume
Despite the many online editors and some searching, I have found it super difficult to find somewhere to make a simple resume with customizable style that doesn't try to fleece me for money.
After learning LaTex, I adapted this from something else found online. There are several commands you can use, but I found it easier to leave the style as it is and fill in your information.  Feel free to clone and make any changes you desire.  This is just something to get you started.

You will need a LaTex compiler to modify this pdf.
